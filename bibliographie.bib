    abstract = {{Since the Web 2.0 era, the Internet is a huge content editing
                  place in which users contribute to the content they
                  browse. Users do not just edit the content but they
                  collaborate on this content. Such shared content can be
                  edited by thousands of people. However, current consistency
                  maintenance algorithms seem not to be adapted to massive
                  collaborative updating. Shared data is usually fragmented
                  into smaller atomic elements that can only be added or
                  removed. Coarse-grained data leads to the possibility of
                  conflicting updates while fine-grained data requires more
                  metadata. In this paper we offer a solution for handling an
                  adaptable granularity for shared data that overcomes the
                  limitations of fixed-grained data approaches. Our approach
                  defines data at a coarse granularity when it is created and
                  refines its granularity only for facing possible conflicting
                  updates on this data. We exhibit three implementations of our
                  algorithm and compare their performances with other
                  algorithms in various scenarios.}},

abstract = {{Distributed collaborative editing systems allow users to work
                  distributed in time, space and across organisations. Trending
                  distributed collaborative editors such as Google Docs,
                  Etherpad or Git have grown in popularity over the years. A
                  new kind of distributed editors based on a family of
                  distributed data structure replicated on several sites called
                  Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT for short) appeared
                  recently. This paper considers a CRDT that represents a
                  distributed sequence of basic elements that can be lines,
                  words or characters (sequence CRDT). The possible operations
                  on this sequence are the insertion and the deletion of
                  elements. Compared to the state of the art, this approach is
                  more decentralised and scales better in terms of the number
                  of participants. However, its space complexity is linear with
                  respect to the total number of inserts and the insertion
                  points in the document. This makes the overall performances
                  of such editors dependent on the editing behaviour of
                  users. This paper proposes and models LSEQ, an adaptive
                  allocation strategy for a sequence CRDT. LSEQ achieves in the
                  average a sub-linear spatial-complexity whatever is the
                  editing behaviour. A series of experiments validates LSEQ
                  showing that it outperforms existing approaches.}},

    abstract = {{Nowadays, real-time editing systems are catching on. Tools
                  such as Etherpad or Google Docs enable multiple authors at
                  dispersed locations to collaboratively write shared
                  documents. In such systems, a replication mechanism is
                  required to ensure consistency when merging concurrent
                  changes performed on the same document. Current editing
                  systems make use of operational transformation (OT), a
                  traditional replication mechanism for concurrent document
                  editing. Recently, Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)
                  were introduced as a new class of replication mechanisms
                  whose concurrent operations are designed to be natively
                  commutative. CRDTs, such as WOOT, Logoot, Treedoc, and RGAs,
                  are expected to be substitutes of replication mechanisms in
                  collaborative editing systems. This paper demonstrates the
                  suitability of CRDTs for real-time collaborative editing. To
                  reflect the tendency of decentralised collaboration, which
                  can resist censorship, tolerate failures, and let users have
                  control over documents, we collected editing logs from
                  real-time peer-to-peer collaborations. We present our
                  experiment results obtained by replaying those editing logs
                  on various CRDTs and an OT algorithm implemented in the same
                  environment.}},

Previous approaches to eventual consistency are ad-hoc and error-prone. We study a principled approach: to base the design of shared data types on some simple formal conditions that are sufficient to guarantee eventual consistency. We call these types Convergent or Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). This paper formalises asynchronous object replication, either state based or operation based, and provides a sufficient condition appropriate for each case. It describes several useful CRDTs, including container data types supporting both \add and \remove operations with clean semantics, and more complex types such as graphs, montonic DAGs, and sequences. It discusses some properties needed to implement non-trivial CRDTs.}},
